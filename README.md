# SocialTable
Skip HootSutie or Buffer.  You're already paying for Airtable â€“ use it as your social media scheduler!

## How it Works
1. Sign in to your social media accounts
   Keys are stored in a SQLite database, and records are added to airtable for each account you've signed in for.

2. Schedule posts in Airtable
   Write your content in Airtable, and select the social account as a Linked Record.

3. Social Table handles the rest.

## Social Media Authentication
Sign into your social media accounts using these urls:
- {Appurl}/auth/linkedin
- {appurl}/auth/meta

Once you've signed in to your accounts, the OAuth tokens will be stored locally in a sqlite database.  A record will be created in Airtable to represent that page/account, but the tokens themselves will not be stored in Airtable.
